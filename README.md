# Two-community-phyto-model-updated
This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Viljoen et al. titled “Climate variability shifts the vertical structure of phytoplankton in the Sargasso Sea” ([LINK TO PREPRINT](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3782167/v1)).
Included is a set of Python scripts used to process data from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site and a script that illustrates how the two-community model, developed in this paper, is fitted to vertical profiles of Chlorophyll and Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) including a few figures related to model validation (scatter and contour plots). 

BATS data used in this study were acquired freely from the BATS data server (http://bats.bios.edu/bats-data/) and the BATS project page at the Biological-Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (https://www.bco-dmo.org/project/2124). Original downloaded data was converted to CSV format before used in this code. We acknowledge all researchers, technicians and data managers who contributed to the BATS site for the profound wealth of data produced since sampling started in the late 1980's.

The Python scripts are in the "Python_Scripts" folder. Each script contains a short description at the start.
